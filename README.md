### HERE IS THE ENTIRE CODE FOR THE ENCODER AND DECODER APP !!


Hi everyone, 
I have created a basic encoder and decoder application using Kotlin and JetPackCompose (for Ui).

===========
| Note :-  |
===========

1) Main Screen 
2) Working Screen Logic
3) @ Composable 
4) setContent 
5) enableEdgeToEdge
6) Box
7) Text
8) OutlineTextField
9) #MutableVariables
10) intent
11) Modifier
12) Crop

============
| Working |
============

* When we open the application we can see the 2 text fields 1st for encoding the text and second one will decode the text

* When we write the text in the encoded textBox after clicking on the button "Encode"  it will encode that text and also we can share that text across multiple applications present in our phone.

* When we paste the text in the "Decode" text field it will deocde that text and you will be easily see the encoded text.


=============
| Use Case  |
=============

* Ensures privacy
* Among friends group circle (when we don't want some other person to see what we are talking) 


You guys can easily find the entire code easily on my #github profile.
